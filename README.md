# Assignment 01-Hello-World

For this assignment, you will be publishing your first webpage! All of the HTML has already been created, all you need to do is replace some text with information about yourself. Once you have followed the instructions below and are looking at the HTML code in your code editor, you will see three areas:

*** YOUR NAME HERE ***

*** YOUR EMAIL HERE ***

*** WHY HERE ***


Simply replace that text with the information it is requesting- your name, your email address, and a few sentences about why you are taking this class.
